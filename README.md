# Launchbyte.Com
This is the remake of the [Launchbyte website](launchbyte.com).
It is hassle to maintain a wordpress site so decided to use [11ty](https://www.11ty.io/) for generating the site. The [Eleventy Netlify boilerplate](https://github.com/danurbanowicz/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate) is by Dan Urbanowicz. It allows me to easily kickstart the site and move both articles and podcasts over.
