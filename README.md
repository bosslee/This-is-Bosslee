# Digital Reboot
2020 is a crazy year. A year where people are moving their lives online and reorienting our relationship with the outside world.

I am taking this opportunity to do a digital reboot. Starting everything fresh and leaving the old baggage behind.

- "This is Bosslee" has been the place I been logging down my life and ideas.
- The first post "How to blog" was created on 2006-10-03. 14 years ago. I cannot imagine how times flies. 
- Throughout the years, I wrote a lot of nonsense. Looking book, they bring a lot of laughters 

I always think that I know what I want and I am focus. But this is not true. I am like a headless chicken running around. 
2017, my startup failed. I went to join a corporate. The last 4 years, I understand myself better. I learn my strengths, weaknesses and importantly I learn to focus.

The projects I committed to years ago were dictating my present and keeping me from feeling like I could make room for whatâ€™s next. 

Now it is time for me to start over.
