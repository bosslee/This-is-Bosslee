# Welcome

Yes this site is plain on purpose.

## What is this site about?

Launchbyte used to be a podcast site. You can find more about it [here](/about).

After a long hiatus, decided to make it something useful again. I will be using it to share the every tech stuff that I have learn and side projects that I am running. This is inspired by a site call [TinyProjects.dev](https://twitter.com/tinyprojectsdev?) where the author documents his process of completing tiny programming projects.

## Why?

I graduated from NUS Business School but I fell in love with Tech and start exploration on my own. I learn a lot from online materials and courses. While no certifications are given from self-learning, these skill sets help me both personally and professionally. 

Currently, I am a Technical Program Manager with Lazada Group.

I am still learning and I believe the best way to learn is to teach.
