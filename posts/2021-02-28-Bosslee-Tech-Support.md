I set up my YouTube account in 03 Apr 2006. I had lots of ideas on what I want to do with it but never took any actions.

I realised that I wanted the outcome of being successful but not the process of going though the hard work on creating content. I was also very concerned on how to people look at me.

> “this guy trying to be an influencer, what does he know”, “video quality is bad” 

However with my recent working experience, it has shape me well. Making me a little more "thick skin". And with me turning 38 years old. I have finally learn that time waits for no man.

I have this quote that I like to share with anyone reading and myself when I read back.

> Because when we give too many fucks, when we choose to give a fuck about everything, then we feel as though we are perpetually entitled to feel comfortable and happy at all times, that’s when life fucks us. via [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck](https://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck)

This is my first video made on 31 Mar 2020.
