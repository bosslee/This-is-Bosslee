At 39, finally I completed my National Service liability. 

**MR LOH!!!**

I made an audio recording of the last in camp training.

All the complaints about NS and "shit work" we have to do.
- the crazy trench digging
- the sleepless nights in tekong
- the delicious rations
- the ridiculous instructions from SGTs and Ocfers (standby bed, standby bunk,
  standby toothbrush)
- the "tcss" moments
- the "WFII" moments and so much more

Looking back, I am glad I served National Service. 
From ah boys to men, men to uncles. I have made good friends. Meet with people
from different backgrounds, but we all come together and completed our
objectives as one. 

The time has come for me to shout

**MR LOH!!!**
