summary: Leaving WordPress and rebuild bosslee.co with 11ty
---

This week, I rebuild the site you are on right now: [bosslee.co](/). 

## Leaving WordPress
This site was hosted on WordPress and I was paying S$60 annually for the site. It was all fun and good with the ability to change themes and having a full pledge CMS. 

However, as I get older. I start to appreciate simplicity. There was no need to change theme regularly. My writings were also mostly in text thus no use for a full pledge CMS. 

## Hello 11ty

I decided to turn my site in to a static website. This site is generated with the [11ty static site generator](https://www.11ty.dev/).

- The site loads faster
- I get to **save** S$60 each year as I host the current site with Netlify which is free for 100GB in bandwidth[^1] per month
- I get to practice Vim. Vim is a text editor on terminal. The magic with Vim is about efficiency. Using Vim forces you to only use your keyboard and that means no more mouse. 

Initially I was thinking of moving all my writings over. This can be easily done by using this [WordPress Export](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown) library. 

But I decided to start over. Taking the opportunity to do a [digital reboot](/about) and archived all my writings.

This site is still very much a work in progress. I’m re-evaluating how I exist online. I don’t know where this is all going, but I thought I may as well have this conversation out loud. 
 
[^1]: 99% of websites currently on the web use no more than 5 GB of bandwidth a month.
