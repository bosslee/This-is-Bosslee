summary: Leaving WordPress and rebuild bosslee.co with 11ty
---

This week, I rebuild the site you are on right now: [bosslee.co](/). 

## Leaving WordPress
This site was hosted on WordPress and I was paying S$60 annually for the site. It was all fun and good with the ability to change themes and having a full pledge CMS. 

However, as I get older. I start to appreciate simplicity. There is an article that I read and I love the ending paragraph. 

> At its heart, web design should be about words. Words don't come after the design is done. Words are the beginning, the core, the focus. via [This is a web page.](https://justinjackson.ca/words.html)

Since I write in plain text so there is no need for a complex CMS. Furthermore keeping the site plain allows you (the reader) to focus my the words. If my writings bring value, you will stay.

## Hello 11ty

I decided to turn my site in to a static website. This site is generated with the [11ty static site generator](https://www.11ty.dev/).

- The site loads faster
- I get to **save** S$60 each year as I host the current site with Netlify which is free for 100GB in bandwidth[^1] per month
- I get to practice Vim. Vim is a text editor on terminal but you can have it on VS Code[^2]. The magic with Vim is about efficiency. Using Vim forces you to only use your keyboard and that means no more mouse. 

Initially I was thinking of moving all my writings over. This can be easily done by using this [WordPress Export](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown) library. 

But I decided to start over. Taking the opportunity to do a [digital reboot](/about) and archived all my writings.

This site is still very much a work in progress. I’m re-evaluating how I exist online. I don’t know where this is all going, but I thought I may as well have this conversation out loud.
